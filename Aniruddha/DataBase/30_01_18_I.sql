/* 
   A database is the main container, it contains the data and log files, and all the schemas within it.
   You always back up a database, it is a discrete unit on its own.

   Schemas are like folders within a database, and are mainly used to group logical objects together,
   which leads to ease of setting permissions by schema.
   All employee-related objects in the "employee" schema, etc.
