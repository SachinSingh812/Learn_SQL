/* 
   Oracle Database contains Logical and Physical Structures.
   Logical Structures are tablespaces, Schema objects, extents and segments.
   Physical Structures are Datafiles, Redo Log Files, Control Files.
    
   All the tables and other objects in Oracle are stored in tablespace logically,
   but physically they are stored in the datafiles associated with the tablespace.
   
   Every Oracle database contains a tablespace named "SYSTEM",
   which Oracle creates automatically when the database is created.
   
   The "SYSTEM" tablespace always contains the data dictionary tables for the entire database.
