   Now the below work will required you to be the "Oracle Database Administrator"
   or you ought to have admin privileges.
   
   As the database administrator, you must plan:
   1.The logical storage structure of the database
   2.The overall database design
   3.A backup strategy for the database
   
   When you complete the database design, you can create the database and open it for normal use.
   You can create a database at installation time, using the Database Configuration Assistant,
   or you can supply your own scripts for creating a database.
   (DBCA) is a Java based GUI tool which is very useful to create, configure and drop databases.
   
   When you start up a database, you create an instance of that database,
   and you choose the state in which the database starts.
   Normally, you would start up an instance by mounting and opening the database,
   thus making it available for any valid user to connect to and perform typical data access operations.
