# Learn SQL
This is a repository for anyone who wants to learn SQL.<br/>
It's an effort by Yash and Aniruddha to understand and learn "SQL".<br/>
You can use all the queries laid down in this tutorial in the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_all">SQL Tryit Editor</a> by <b>W3Schools</b>.<br/><br/>
This is the Data Base we're using from https://www.w3schools.com/<br/>
You can also practice on Oracle offical website dedicated wholly to SQL from here
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/application-development/livesql/livesql-2715848.html">Live SQL</a><br/>
<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">On some points of the tutorial <b>Oracle</b> or <b>PL/SQL</b> Clauses and Fucntions were used. So you can download <b>Oracle Express Edition 11g</b> which does not requir any connection with SQL Server Client and made for the use of developers and learners, from <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/database-technologies/express-edition/downloads/index.html">here</a> or there is a online interpreter provided by <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/html5/">TutorialsPoint</a> with online <b>Oracle XE 11.2.0-1.0</b> all built in, which include some basic tables in it which you can use to practice on, from <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/oracle_terminal_online.php">here</a>. The Tables that I found were there were DEPT, EMP, DUAL, SYSTEM_PRIVILEGE_MAP, TABLE_PRIVILEGE_MAP, STMT_AUDIT_OPTION_MAP, AUDIT_ACTIONS.</span><br/><br/>
